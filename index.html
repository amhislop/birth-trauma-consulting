Although, vaginal injury was poorly identified prior to the introduction of imaging technology in the 21st Century, recent studies report TWO different types of serious damage that include: pelvic floor damage and perineal tearing. Currently, this research has been poorly disseminated in maternity settings. Some women suffer from both injuries.

This is inaccurate and confusing to women. The following definitions are correct:</p><ul><li>Pelvic floor damage occurs during complicated deliveries, when an internal pelvic floor structure, called the levator ani muscle (LAM) becomes detached from one or both sides of the pubic bone and, can result in pelvic organs prolapsing into the vagina e.g. bladder, bowel and/ or uterus.</li><li>Perineal injury occurs during the crowning of baby’s head and affects the area between the vaginal entrance and anus. Injuries are well known and, can result in minor to serious tearing that can result in faecal incontinence.</li></ul><p>(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ajo.12286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skinner et al 2015</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00737-017-0802-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skinner et al, 2018.</a>)</p></details><details><summary>What is birth trauma?</summary><p>Mothers who experience traumatic birth events and/ or debilitating physical effects of vaginal damage can also suffer from symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that include: avoidance of birth related issues in everyday life; panic attacks; hypervigilance; detachment from partners &amp; friends; poor bonding with baby; nightmares; feelings of numbness; flashbacks/reexperiencing traumatic birth events. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00737-017-0802-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skinner et al, 2018.</a>)</p></details><details><summary>Do many mothers suffer from vaginal birth damage?</summary><p>Recent studies show that the TWO types of major vaginal birth damage are more common than previously realized and often poorly identified.</p><p>Pelvic floor damage affects: 10 to 30 % of first time mothers in developed countries.Severe perineal injuries or 3rd and 4th degree tears affect approximately 4 to 6 % of mothers.

It is ideal if you can attend appointment/s with your wife/partner regarding her accurate assessment of physical and /or psychological trauma, so the clinician can explain relevant issues to both of you. Otherwise, it is difficult understanding a partner’s consequences without medical guidance. The following may help:</p><ul><li>Notice whether she finds lifting objects or standing for extended periods difficult.</li><li>Observe whether she has nightmares, avoids talking about her birth, or appears emotionally detached.</li></ul></details><details><summary>Does sex hurt my partner if she has vaginal birth injuries?</summary><p>This may be dependent on marital communication and how soon after birth you have sex. The following may help:</p><ul><li>Healing could take more than 6 weeks and/or up to several months. </li><li>Women who have vaginal prolapses often find sex very confronting. Most report that if they have sex, the bulging sensation in the vagina, lower back pain and/or numbness are all distressing. If they suffer from perineal tearing as well, pain may be very overt if the wound has not healed.</li><li>More information is provided by the birth trauma expert, who will discreetly discuss individual needs with affected women and/ or partners and, provide access to informed clinicians for treatment options.</li></ul></details><details><summary>Does vaginal birth injury affect my wife/ partner’s psychological health?</summary><p>This is dependent on many factors that include validation of birth injuries, but the following experiences of women may assist:</p><p>Recently published interviews with 40 women, who were diagnosed with severe pelvic floor damage and perineal injuries, revealed that more than 2/3 suffered from 3-4 symptoms of postpartum PTSD including: panic attacks/anxiety; hypervigilance; detachment from partners, poor bonding with baby; nightmares; numbness and flashbacks/reexperiencing of traumatic events <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/ptsd/what-is-ptsd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as per DSM-5</a>.</p><p>Postnatal depression (PND) was not detected in this cohort and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Screening (EPDS) was not efficacious in revealing symptoms of postpartum PTSD.
