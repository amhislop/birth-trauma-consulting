Despite being poorly identified prior to the introduction of imaging technology in the 21st Century, recent studies describe TWO different types of damage that include: pelvic floor damage and perineal tearing. Currently, this research has been poorly disseminated in maternity settings. Some women suffer from both of these injuries. ( <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ajo.12286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skinner et al 2015</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ajo.12286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skinner et al, 2018.</a>)</p></details><details><summary>How is pelvic floor damage different to perineal injury?</summary><p>Currently, both forms of injury are often synonymously described as perineal damage. This is inaccurate and confusing to women. The following definitions are correct:</p><ul><li>Pelvic floor damage occurs during complicated deliveries, when an internal pelvic floor structure, called the levator ani muscle (LAM) becomes detached from one or both sides of the pubic bone and, can result in pelvic organs prolapsing into the vagina e.g. bladder, bowel and/ or uterus.</li><li>Perineal injury occurs during the crowning of baby’s head and affects the area between the vaginal entrance and anus. Injuries are well known and, can result in minor to serious tearing that can result in faecal incontinence.</li></ul><p>(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ajo.12286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skinner et al 2015</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ajo.12286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skinner et al, 2018.</a>)</p></details><details><summary>What is birth trauma?</summary><p>Emotional trauma symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that occur in response to debilitating physical effects ofvaginal injury after traumatic vaginal birth events.</p><p>Currently, symptoms of postnatal PTSD are poorly identified and include: avoidance of birth related issues in everydaylife; panic attacks; hypervigilance; detachment from partners &amp; friends; poor bonding with baby; nightmares; feelings of
numbness; flashbacks/reexperiencing traumatic birth events. </p></details><details><summary>Do many mothers suffer from vaginal birth damage?</summary><p>Recent studies show that the TWO types of major vaginal birth damage are more common than previously realized and oftenpoorly identified.</p><p>Pelvic floor damage affects: 10 to 30 % of first time mothers in developed countries.Severe perineal injuries or 3rd and 4th degree tears affect approximately 4 to 6 % of mothers.
