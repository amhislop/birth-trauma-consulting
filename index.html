          <div class="inner">
            <p>
              To be the leading postnatal agency in Australia that provides
              birth trauma advocacy and access to improved health care by
              facilitating evidence based management, support and optimal
              communication for women and partners suffering from the effects of
              pelvic organ prolapse, bowel, urinary, sexual impairment and
              postpartum PTSD.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3 class="section-title">Why</h3>
          <div class="inner">
            <ul>
              <li>
                Recent international research observes that more women than
                previously realized suffer ‘silently’ from physical and
                psychological effects of vaginal birth damage that they describe
                as “…hidden and overlooked’.
              </li>
              <li>
                Since the introduction of imaging in the 21st Century,
                international studies reveal that during lengthy vaginal births
                using forceps to deliver large babies, a pelvic floor structure
                known as the levator ani muscle, becomes detached from the pubic
                bone. This injury is different to the more well-known perineal
                damage and can result in the bladder, bowel and/ or uterus
                prolapsing into the vagina. Other research shows that both types
                of birth damage have debilitating consequences for women.
              </li>
              <li>
                Perinatal mental health research reports that vaginal birth
                injury symptoms are poorly identified, embarrassing to explain
                and often result in barriers to care with reduced quality of
                life, marital harmony and postpartum PTSD. 1,2,3
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h3 class="section-title">Our Approach</h3>
          <div class="inner">
            <ul>
              <li>
                An expert birth trauma consultant works respectfully with
                individuals, couples and/or groups of clinicians to identify
                their gaps in knowledge regarding physical, sexual and
                psychological effects of vaginal birth trauma, that may have
                prevented access to postnatal health improvement.
              </li>
              <li>
                Birth Trauma Consultancy advocates that health literacy
                strategies, supported by World Health Organization [W.H.0.]
                directives, are an integral means of disseminating current
                research findings on poorly understood effects of vaginal birth
                trauma to facilitate evidence based decisions of health
                improvement and reduce obstacles to postnatal healthcare.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sessions provide empathetic insight and support for maternal
                sexual dysfunction after vaginal birth damage, that is reported
                by mothers as “…a taboo topic and secret women’s business”.
              </li>
              <li>
                Programs are based on findings from published interviews with
                traumatized women and partners and does not seek to apportion
                blame to health providers.
              </li>
              <li>
                Birth Trauma Consultancy promotes integration of care between
                health providers, maternity and mental health clinicians to
                improve communication and postnatal outcomes for traumatized
                women and partners.
